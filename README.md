For my quantum hw

At first for this problem we observed that single well graph did not grow as fast
as a multiple well graph. This makes sense because the increase in PE throughout
the graph would cause the KE to decrease. When we changed the location of the center of 
the wells and a band bap appeared. This band gap was present because when the wave number
or momentum increases, in the case of the band gap, the anti-nodes align with the high
potential, meaning that wave function requires more energy than when the wavefunction node
aligns with the high potential region
